# 🌸 The Flower Awakens — An Interactive Graduation Dress

🎓 **Graduation** is not just an event; it’s a milestone, a celebration, and a statement.  
**The Flower Awakens** is my graduation dress: a wearable art piece that fuses **fashion**, **engineering**, and **interactive technology**. It gives the wearer and their audience the experience of controlling the dress via **hand motion**, as if wielding *The Force* or telekinesis.

## 💡 Concept  
The Flower Awakens is more than just a dress—it’s a celebration of individuality and achievement in a traditionally male-dominated field. The interactive nature of the dress symbolizes the power of connection, collaboration, and breaking barriers.

### Inspiration  
The concept draws on the idea of telekinesis, giving the person in front of the dress the illusion of controlling its movements with their hand gestures. It’s playful, empowering, and awe-inspiring—a perfect metaphor for graduating with the skills to shape the world around you.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview  

### Components  
- **Arduino UNO**: The brains behind the dress.  
- **GY-521 Module (Accelerometer)**: Detects hand motion and translates it into commands for the dress.  
- **White LEDs**: Mimicking stars, adding to the celestial and magical feel.  
- **Resistors**: To control LED brightness and ensure circuit safety.

### How It Works  
1. The accelerometer tracks the motion of the person standing in front of the dress.  
2. The data is processed by the Arduino UNO to control LED patterns and servo movements on the dress.  
3. The result? A magical interaction that feels like controlling the dress with *The Force*.

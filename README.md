# 🌌 The Flower Awakens — An Interactive Graduation Dress

🎓 **Graduation** is not just an event; it’s a milestone, a celebration, and a statement.  
**The Flower Awakens** is my graduation dress: a wearable art piece that fuses **fashion**, **engineering**, and **interactive technology**. It gives the wearer and their audience the experience of controlling the dress via **hand motion**, as if wielding *The Force* or telekinesis.

## 💡 Concept  
The Flower Awakens is more than just a dress—it’s a celebration of individuality and achievement as a woman in engineering. The interactive nature of the dress symbolizes the power of connection, collaboration, and breaking barriers.

### Inspiration  
The concept draws on the idea of 'The Force', giving the person in front of the dress the illusion of controlling its movements with their hand gestures. It’s playful, empowering, and awe-inspiring—a perfect metaphor for graduating with the skills to shape the world around you.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview  

### Components  
- **Arduino UNO**: The microcontroller managing the entire system.  
- **Servo Motors**: Drive the mechanical movements of the dress (e.g., petals or fabric).  
- **16-Pin Servo Driver**: Enables precise control of multiple servo motors.  
- **Webcam**: Captures hand movements from the user standing in front of the dress.  
- **OpenCV (Python)**: Processes webcam video feed to detect hand gestures and control the dress.

### How It Works  
1. **Hand Detection**: The cam captures hand movements in real-time.  
2. **Gesture Processing**: OpenCV processes the video feed to identify specific gestures.  
3. **Motion Translation**: Detected gestures are sent to the Arduino, which controls the servo motors to move parts of the dress.  
4. **Interactive Feedback**: The result is a magical experience where the user feels as though they are controlling the dress with *The Force*.
